The WordPress theme for [VéroniqueBellamy.fr](https://veroniquebellamy.fr/)

## … What?
This is the WordPress theme I’ll be using for my professional site.

## … Why?
Because it’s about high time I launched my professional site. It's also on Github because I could use more stuff on my GitHub to show recruiters.

## Is it open source?
No. Because I've added the code to implement my licence of Font Awesome 5, this is no longer a 100% FOSS project. However, the code is still visible in order to show how I implemented the custom functionality in this theme.
